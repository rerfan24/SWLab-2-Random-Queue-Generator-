## How this program developed

1. The programs structure was in the first couple of commits in `main` branch.
1. After that developing of the program started in `firstAlg` branch.
1. After Two or more commits of developing the program a Pull Request was made to merge two branches.
1. Then a new branch called `updateFirstAlg` was made to make modifications on the program.
1. After Merging it like the last one I edited README on github a little bit and added a commit.
   because I am alone I couldn't create a conflict with another person and I did it inside the README file.
1. Then I changed README file on my Laptop a little bit that made the pull command turns into a conflict.
1. After resolving the conflict I commited the correct version. 
1. another branch called `fixbugs` created to correct some bugs and merged like others as well.
